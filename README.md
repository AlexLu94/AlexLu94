**ðŸ‘‹ Hi there,**  
**I'm Alessandro Lupo**

ðŸ”¬ Currently, Iâ€™m a researcher working at the intersection of **Machine Learning** and **Photonics**.

ðŸ’» I can usually be found in the lab or deep in code, crafting algorithms and designing experimental setups.

ðŸš€ Iâ€™m a big believer in cross-disciplinary innovation, focused on advancing and sharing knowledge to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.
